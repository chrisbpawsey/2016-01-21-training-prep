I am from the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre in Perth.  My office is at the University of Western Australia, where I work as a Supercomputing Specialist.  I have been lately working on the NeCTAR Research Cloud project doing outreach and training.  My undergrad is in Mechanical Engineering with a Masters degree in Scientific Computing from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.  I have been using the Software Carpentry material for the NeCTAR workshops I give in Perth.
